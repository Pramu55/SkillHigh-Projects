```markdown
# Spam Email Classifier 📧

**Final Year Project** | **Machine Learning** | **Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit**

---

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. It covers all key stages including data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, model training with Logistic Regression, evaluation, and an interactive web app using Streamlit.

---

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize email text by removing punctuation, URLs, and stopwords.
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF vectorization for transforming text into numerical features.
- **Model:** Logistic Regression classifier trained on labeled email data.
- **Evaluation:** Generates accuracy and classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **User Interface:** Streamlit-based UI to input email text and receive real-time spam predictions.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spam_email_classifier_project
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Train the model** (optional, model & vectorizer are included)

```bash
cd src
python train_model.py
```

5. **Run the Streamlit app**

```bash
streamlit run ../app/app.py
```

6. **Use the web UI**

* Paste or type any email text
* Click **Classify**
* See prediction: Spam or Not Spam

---

## Dataset

The `data/emails.csv` file contains a small sample dataset with labeled spam and non-spam email texts for quick experimentation. For better accuracy, consider replacing it with larger, real-world datasets like:

* [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)
* [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/)

---

## Model Details

* **Preprocessing:** Custom cleaning (lowercase, remove punctuation, URLs, stopwords)
* **Vectorization:** TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency)
* **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression (a simple, efficient linear classifier)

## Future Improvements

* Use more advanced NLP models (e.g., transformers, LSTM)
* Expand dataset and perform hyperparameter tuning
* Deploy as a REST API for integration with email clients
* Add multi-language support
* Improve UI with detailed explanations for predictions
